name="NinePatchButton"
description="A new type of node that combines the features of the NinePatchRect, the Button, and the TextureButton, with the NinePatchRect being used as the base. We also took the liberty to add a custom sound system to the NinePatchButton, which allows you to assign sounds for pressing it, hovering over it, attempting to press it while it is disabled, and focusing it."
